# Hi, I'm Dhruv

### About Me
I'm a 3rd-year ECE student at **MNIT Jaipur** who likes building things that actually solve problems I’ve faced myself. I enjoy working on projects where there’s a clear pain point, figuring out a clean solution, and then shipping it.

- Built an **AI-powered study tool** to analyze previous year question papers and generate exam-focused insights
- Currently learning **Next.js** and **system design fundamentals**
- Enjoy automating repetitive tasks and turning personal pain points into usable software
